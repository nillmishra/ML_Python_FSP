What is Machine Learning?
Machine  Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that aloe machine to learn and improves their performance based on data

A Computer program is said to learn from Experience E with respect to some Task T and some performance measure P, it its performance on T as measured by P improves with Experience E.

What are different types of machine learning?
1) Supervised Learning
2)Unsupervised Learning 
4)Semi- Supervised Learning
5)Reinforcement

1) Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm :-
:- Linear Regression
:- Logistic Regression
:- Polynomial Regression
:- Lasso Regression
:- Ridge Regression

2) Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithm:-

:- clustering
:- Dimensionality reduction
:- Association rule
:- Anomaly Detection

Reward and punishment are Reinforcement pairs!!
